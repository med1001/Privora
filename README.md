## **How to Clone the Project**

Run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/med1001/Privora.git
cd Privora
```

---

## **How to Build and Run the C Chat Application**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure that you have **GCC** and **Make** installed. If not, install them using:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```
Before building the project, ensure that the libcurl is installed using the following command on Ubuntu-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### **Building the Server & Client**
1. Navigate to the `server/` directory and compile the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   make  # Builds the server
   ```
2. Navigate to the `client/` directory and compile the client:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   make  # Builds the client
   ```

### **Running the Chat Application**
After building, you can run the client and server from the `build/` directory in both client and server:
```bash
cd build # cd to the server build repo (Privora/server/build)
./server &  # Start the server in the background
./client  # Start the client # after cd to the client build repo (Privora/client/build)
```

## **Setting Up Flask Authentication**
The Flask authentication system handles user account creation and private messaging authentication.

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. If not, install it using:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```

### **Setting Up the Virtual Environment**
1. Navigate to the `flask_auth/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask_auth
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Configuring the `.env` File**
Before running the Flask authentication server, you need to properly set up the `.env` file. This file contains important environment variables required for the application to work, such as SMTP credentials for sending confirmation emails.

#### Steps:

1. **Locate the `.env.example` File:**
   In the `Privora/flask_auth` directory, there is a hidden file named `.env.example`. This file contains an example structure for the `.env` file, but without sensitive values.

2. **Create the `.env` File:**
   Copy `.env.example` to create your actual `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit the `.env` File:**
   Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual SMTP credentials. The required environment variables are:

   ```plaintext
   SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
   FROM_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   ```

   - **SMTP_SERVER:** The address of your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail).
   - **SMTP_PORT:** The port to use for the SMTP connection (e.g., `587` for Gmail).
   - **SMTP_USERNAME:** Your email address used to send emails.
   - **SMTP_PASSWORD:** Your SMTP password (or App Password if using Gmail with two-factor authentication).
   - **FROM_EMAIL:** The email address to appear as the sender for confirmation and recovery emails.

4. **Security Note:**
   - **Do not** push the `.env` file to public repositories to protect sensitive information like your SMTP credentials. 
   - Make sure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits:
     ```bash
     .env
     ```

### **Running the Flask Server**
Start the authentication server with:
```bash
python auth_server.py
```
By default, Flask runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

---

## **How to Clean the C Build**
To remove compiled binaries and build artifacts, run:
```bash
make clean
```
Run this command separately in both `server/` and `client/` directories if needed.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Add private chat functionality between two users.
